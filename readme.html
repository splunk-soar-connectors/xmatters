<h2>Historical Data Access</h2>
<p>You can access historical data using to and from. By setting the to and from parameters to dates in the past, you automatically query historical data to return results. However, you cannot have a timeframe that spans from the past to the future and there is a 24-hour synchronization window for on-call data before it is available. This is to ensure that if you request on-call data for the current day, the request doesn’t try to simultaneously draw data from both historical data and the runtime data. For historical data queries, the length of time you can set is limited by your pricing plan.</p>
<br>
<h2>Accessing Who is On Call Now</h2>
<p>When accessing who is on call now, or for a shift in the future, you’ll need to set the from parameter to a time no more than 24 hours in the past, and the to parameter for a time that is in the future. f no timeframe is specified, the query returns only the shifts that are currently on call. Shift times are defined in universal time (UTC) format and may not reflect the time zone of the authenticating user.</p>

<h2>Port Information</h2>
<p>
    The app uses HTTP/ HTTPS protocol for communicating with the xMatters server. Below are the default ports used by Splunk SOAR.
